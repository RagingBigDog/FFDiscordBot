# Fantasy Football Discord Bot

This discord bot, when operational, will allow discord users to make a private bid, see/change bids as needed, store the bids in an encrypted file, call all bids when the commissioner/server owner calls them, and display help messages for users. The goal is to use slash commands to make it easier for users to operate the bot.

It will allow users to make a private bid either via a private channel created (and then removed by the bot after the bid is placed) or by direct message. This is to reduce the likely hood of the information being revealed to the commisioner/server owner during the bidding period. The bid will then be confirmed be the user. If a private channel was created, the bot will also close it after confirmation on the bid or after a certain amount of time.

The bot will also be able to do one of the above when a user wants to either see their bids or change them. 

The bids will be stored in an encrypted file, which will be revealed when the commisioner uses the command to print them. 

There will also be a help command to display the different powers each owner has as well as help on how to use the bot. 

This will be updated with the commands and/or if any other features are added.
